The cost of the house was `$800,000`. Shaun made a down payment of `25%` of the price. He financed the remaining amount using a 6-year loan with an interest rate of `7%` per annum (compounded monthly). Shaun is now buying a car worth `$60,000`, which he is planning to finance using a 1-year loan with an interest rate of `12%` per annum. Both loans are paid back in EMIs.
